    <h1>Theronos</h1>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p>
      Theranos (/ˈθɛrənoʊs/) was an American

      health technology corporation.[2] It was initially touted as a
      breakthrough technology company, with claims of having devised
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"> blood tsts</a> blood
      tests that required only very small amounts of blood and could be
      performed very rapidly using small automated devices the company had
      developed. However, these claims were later proven to be false.[3][4][5]
      Founded in 2003 by 19-year-old

      Elizabeth Holmes,[6] Theranos raised more than US$700 million from venture
      capitalists and private investors,[7] resulting in a $10 billion valuation
      at its peak in 2013 and 2014.[8][9]

      A turning point came in 2015 when medical research professors

      and

        href="

        >Eleftherios Diamandis</a
      >, along with investigative journalist John Carreyrou of The Wall Street
      Journal, questioned the validity of Theranos' technology. The company
      faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical
      authorities, investors, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
      (SEC),<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Medicare_%26_Medicaid_Services"
        >Centers for Medicare
      </a>
      Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state attorneys general,
      former business partners, patients, and others.[10] By June 2016, it was
      estimated that Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to
      virtually nothing.[11] The company was near bankruptcy until it received,
      in 2017, a $100 million loan from Fortress Investment Group secured by its
      patents.[12]

    <p>
      In July 2016, Theranos received sanctions from the CMS, including the
      revocation of its
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_Laboratory_Improvement_Amendments"
      >
        CLIA
      </a>
      CLIA certificate and prohibition of Holmes and other company officials
      from owning or operating a laboratory for two years.[13] Theranos
      announced it would close its laboratory operations and wellness centers to
      work on miniature medical testing machines.[14] In April 2017, Theranos
      said it had reached a settlement agreement with CMS.[15] Following the CMS
      sanctions, the Walgreens pharmacy chain terminated its contract with
      Theranos and filed a lawsuit claiming continuous
      <a

      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract"
        >breaches of contract</a
      >
      . The suit was settled out of court, with Theranos compensating

      for a much smaller amount than the claimed $140 million, reported at about
      $30 million. After efforts to find a buyer went nowhere, what remained of
      the company dissolved on September 4, 2018.[16]

      On March 14, 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and former company president
      <a

      were charged with "massive fraud" by the SEC.[17] One section of the
      complaint says Holmes falsely claimed in 2014 that the company had annual
      revenues of $100 million, a thousand times more than the actual figure of
      $100,000.[18] Theranos and Holmes agreed to resolve the charges against
      them, with Holmes paying a fine of $500,000, returning the remaining 18.9
      million shares that she held, relinquishing her control of the company,
      and being barred from being an officer or director of any
      <a
        href="
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company"
      >
        public company</a
      >
      for ten years.[19] According to the agreement, if Theranos were acquired
      or otherwise liquidated, Holmes would not profit from her ownership until
      more than $750 million was returned to investors and other preferred
      shareholders. Theranos and Holmes neither admitted nor denied the
      allegations in the SEC's complaint.[7] Balwani did not settle.[20] On June
      15, 2018,
      <a

        >the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California</a
      >
      announced the indictment of Holmes on wire fraud and conspiracy charges.
      Balwani was also indicted on the same charges.[21] The trial was scheduled
      to commence in August 2020,[22] but it has been delayed due to the
      COVID-19 pandemic and Holmes' pregnancy. Holmes' trial is currently
      scheduled to begin on August 31, 2021[23], while Balwani's trial has been
      postponed until January 11, 2022.[24
